Zeolites are therefore used as sieves or filters to remove molecules of a particular size. Liquids and gases can pass through these spaces or pores.

Brass, for example, is a mixture of copper and 20%-45% zinc.\nAdequate amounts of zinc are essential to a healthy life in all humans and animals. It is necessary for the function of a number of different enzymes. It has also been proved necessary for skin and bone growth as well as sexual maturation. The body uses zinc to process food and nutrients. When animals do not have enough zinc in their systems, they need to consume 50% more food to match the weight gain of an animal with enough zinc in its body. About 0.003% zinc is needed for proper health.\nZinc is relatively non-reactive in air or water. Consequently, it is applied in thin layers to iron and steel products that need to be protected from rusting. This process is called galvanizing. Galvanizing is done in a number of ways. Generally, the metal is dipped in molten zinc. It can also be done by electroplating or by painting on a layer of zinc compound.\nZinc is used in making rubber and paint, chemicals, agricultural applications, in the rubber industry, in TV screens, fluorescent lights and for dry cell batteries.
